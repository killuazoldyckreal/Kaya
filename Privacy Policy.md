# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [20-09-2024]_

By adding **Kaya Music Bot** to your Discord server, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to this Privacy Policy.

This document outlines the information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your data when you interact with **Kaya Music Bot**. The terms "you" and "your" refer to users who access servers where **Kaya Music Bot** is active, while "we," "us," and "our" refer to **Kaya Music Bot** and its development team. By using our bot, you consent to the collection and handling of your information as described in this policy.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will take effect immediately after they are posted. Continued use of our bot indicates acceptance of these updates. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our bot or support channels.

## Privacy Commitment

We prioritize the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy details how we handle the data you provide while interacting with **Kaya Music Bot** and how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and disclose that information.

This policy applies to:
- Information collected when you interact directly with the bot by running a command (e.g., `/play`).
- Information collected when another user mentions you in commands (e.g., `/play @user`).
- Information collected from any server where **Kaya Music Bot** has permissions to access messages.

This Privacy Policy does **not** apply to:
- Offline activities or data collected through other websites operated by third parties.
- Any data you share with third-party websites, such as Discord bot listing sites.

Please read this policy carefully. If you disagree with our practices, do not use **Kaya Music Bot**. Your continued use of our bot signifies your acceptance of our Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
We collect only the necessary information required for **Kaya Music Bot** to operate within Discord. You are not required to provide personal information outside of running commands through the bot.

Examples of information we collect:
- **User IDs**: Collected when commands are executed in the bot (e.g., `/play` command).
- **Guild/Server IDs and Channel IDs**: Required to process and manage commands.
  
This information is stored securely and helps us improve the bot’s performance, track usage analytics, and maintain Discord's best practices for data storage and privacy. We do not require or collect extensive data like Guild Members or Presence Intent data unless necessary for bot functionality.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)
We may collect technical information about your device when you use **Kaya Music Bot**, such as:
- **IP address** or connection type
- **Browser type and operating system** (for web-related interactions)
- **Usage analytics**: Which bot commands are most used, and how the bot is performing within servers.

This information helps us improve the bot's functionality and offer a better user experience. This data is typically collected through tools such as "cookies" or similar technologies for web interfaces (if applicable).

### Information From Third-Party Websites
When you interact with third-party websites (e.g., voting sites like Top.gg), they may collect your username and details like timestamps. **Kaya Music Bot** may also receive this information, but only for the purpose of providing functionality (e.g., tracking votes).

We do not track your activity across third-party websites, nor do we store any personal information shared with these services beyond what is necessary for **Kaya Music Bot's** operations.

## Third-Party Links

Our bot may provide links to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third-party websites. Once you leave **Kaya Music Bot's** ecosystem, any data you provide is governed by the respective third-party policies.

Please review their privacy practices if you interact with external services.

## Disclosure of Information

We may share non-personal, aggregated data (such as total command usage across servers) without restriction. However, personally identifiable information will only be shared in the following scenarios:
- To support our services, such as for server management and bot functionality.
- To comply with legal obligations or respond to valid legal processes (e.g., a court order).
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of **Kaya Music Bot**, its users, or others.
- In case of a merger, acquisition, or transfer of assets, where personal data would be part of the transferred assets.

We will not sell or share your personal information with third parties without your explicit consent.

## Security Measures

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We use encryption, access control, and other industry-standard practices to safeguard the data we collect. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

We retain user data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. If you remove **Kaya Music Bot** from your server, we will no longer collect data from that server, and stored data may be deleted periodically.

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted here, and we encourage you to review this document periodically. Your continued use of **Kaya Music Bot** after any updates are posted constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact our support team through our official channels.

Thank you for using Kaya Music Bot!
